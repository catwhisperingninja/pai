Things are changing very rapidly for the worse in the USA, and I expect the feds to start arresting journalists, and for YouTube to start deplatforming anyone who is not a far-right Christian nationalist. The platform is designed for 3 major things: 1) make it very hard to de-platform users/censorship resistant except all sexual imagery is banned worldwide, 2) allow for uploaders to have both attritubtion and compensation without requiring surveillance metadata from Adobe, etc. as that can be used to prosecute, 3) solve current challenges with misinformation and deepfakes with a \"Moderation Engine\", a \"Quorum of Five\" AI agents all sourced from diverse open-source models who are experts in all major languages and cultures, and who debate/vote amongst themselves as to whether a piece of content is factual, fake, or art. I worked on this for quite some time, been thinking about it for some 15 years. only now that AI is a reality is it possible. The agents have personalities, and each a characteristic metadata stamp of approval. the personalities and stamps aren't within mvp scope, and I'm only spinning up 3 of 5 models, but I'm designing for video content first, as that is by far the hardest. What I could use help with is: I'll xfr 2-3 videos, locally. one will be fact, one fake, and I don't have an \"art\" one handy, but I'll find one. I've built a custom API endpoint to upload to. It's taking forever to debug the front end, and I could use your regular comms with the architect default agent doing most of the building as in \"try uploading now\" \"uploading\", \"ok, done.

{"display":"I do, sometimes. Ok. you reviewed architect msgs? and repomix file? we have all the req bg info to launch debate council? Oh - include a note about the Grok 4-agent debate format. literally launched yesterday. I think it's coincidental. architect and I discussed - my spec has been live on github for at least a month, if not longer. that's my \"defensive publication\" for the IP, plus grok is not factually reliable, not transparent, and rephrensibly has a known csam problem it is not really bothering to investigate or resolve. Debate council should also know and pdrfit architect agrees that I am very wise to keep my real identity under wraps as much as possible, so patent filing is inadvisiable. I have, so far, as I know how authoritarian governments operate, and I am set on staying out of political prison. This project is *possibly*, I have provided myself the option, possibly my ticket to canada on a work visa. But I am also started a delare C corp - but it's very important to note that the startup is intended as my media company/content creation. Parallax Drift is as yet just a random thing living on the internet that it appears no one knows even exists. I guess I could check cloudflare for traffic. : \"Such Wow Incorporated\", I am founder/CEO, notably, with 33% equity, as I prefer to not have dumb cofounder fights, and if successful on Substack/video/etc., I'd prefer 3 cofounders, as I want to bounce between projects. I have an academic research arm too, as yet unnamed, likely a non-profit doing interpretability and AI safety research. Relevant also is I have been operating everything as much as possible via psuedonym, and my opsec is solid but I am unavoidably compromised by the fact that it is now infuriatingly illegal to run as business banking account without paying for brick/mortar office, coworking is not sufficient, go ahead and verify. so I have had to pay for inference/vercel etc with a credit card. Plan on moving to crypto-only, deleting accounts. Considering creating Estonian business identity also, visa app to Canada must include a business originally registered in Canada, this is why it is not under the banner of my startup. Vancouver is destination, only place I am willing to go. Open to other countries, originally planned Medellin, but then Trump invaded Venezuela. Yes, he did, go check. They literally kidnapped Maduro and brought him back to NY. They are destroying all our alliances. The situation is insane.

{"display":"yeah - it's important that the agents know that crypto payments only simply were not available *TO MY KNOWLEDGE* at the time of building MVP. Reasonable to understand why I did not sign a 7k/mo+ office lease in Bay Area with zero revenue. My business banking account was closed because I was not willing to associate my residential address, FWIW. But yes, I hated it the whole way through, but to get an EIN you MUST provide your SSN. So Such Wow Incorporated, fwiw, has never been associated with my home (which I own), only a Stable address, and Twilio phone number. I had a Mercury acct, they changed the rules a couple months after I'd set everything up...I had no idea that was an impending change affecting everyone. I was deeply frustrated. If you could inform the agents, that would be helpful. I've done the best I can, while spending money responsibly. These are the chokepoints. If I can delete an account, clean anything up, please inform. I am preparing for doxxing. All I can do is *delay* the authorities. I can't stop them. But that gives me time to get out. I am way ahead though, even now. They just arrested Don Lemon a couple weeks ago. People still think a \"blue tsunami\" midterm election with change things. Not if they refuse to leave office, it won't. So I still have most of 2026 before the military imposes martial law, etc. I anticipate that most Democrat election winners won't be allowed to take their seats, or there will be ridiculous delaying tactics.
