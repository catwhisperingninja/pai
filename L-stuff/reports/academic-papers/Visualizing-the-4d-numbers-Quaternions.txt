Title: Visualizing-the-4d-numbers-Quaternions
00:00:00.000 What you're looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication,
00:00:04.612 or rather you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion
00:00:08.932 happening on a four-dimensional sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space,
00:00:14.128 one which you'll understand by the end of this video.
00:00:21.560 Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and
00:00:24.018 often underappreciated number system from math.
00:00:27.240 Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers,
00:00:31.347 quaternions are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers.
00:00:35.300 But they're not just playful mathematical shenanigans,
00:00:37.988 they have a surprisingly pragmatic utility for describing rotation in three dimensions,
00:00:42.367 and even for quantum mechanics.
00:00:45.020 The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math.
00:00:48.200 The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life
00:00:51.508 seeking a three-dimensional number system, analogous to the complex numbers.
00:00:55.780 And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning whether or not he
00:00:59.240 had figured out how to divide triples, and he would always say no, not yet.
00:01:03.340 But on October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin,
00:01:07.043 he realized, with a supposed flash of insight,
00:01:09.641 that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to the complex numbers,
00:01:13.953 but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions
00:01:17.767 describing space and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in
00:01:21.746 some kind of fourth dimension.
00:01:23.880 He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge,
00:01:28.267 which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.
00:01:32.300 Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their
00:01:35.653 dot product and the cross product and things like that didn't really
00:01:39.107 exist in Hamilton's time, at least not in a standardized form.
00:01:42.800 So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary
00:01:46.638 language with which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space,
00:01:50.636 even forming an official quaternion society to proselytize his discovery.
00:01:55.580 Unfortunately, this was balanced with mathematicians on the other side of the fence,
00:01:59.786 who believed that the confusing notion of quaternion multiplication was
00:02:03.391 not necessary for describing three dimensions,
00:02:05.744 resulting in some truly hilarious old-timey trash talk legitimately calling them evil.
00:02:10.840 It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland,
00:02:14.186 whose author you may know was an Oxford mathematician,
00:02:16.814 was written in reference to quaternions, that the chaotic table placement
00:02:20.351 changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain quotes were
00:02:23.793 referencing their non-commutative nature.
00:02:26.880 Fast forward about a century, and the computing industry gave
00:02:29.969 quaternions a resurgence among programmers who work with graphics
00:02:33.311 and robotics and anything involving orientation in 3D space.
00:02:36.940 And this is because they give an elegant way to describe and compute 3D rotations,
00:02:41.158 which is computationally more efficient than other methods,
00:02:44.245 and which also avoids a lot of the numerical errors that arise in these other methods.
00:02:49.280 The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love
00:02:51.893 from a completely different direction, quantum mechanics.
00:02:55.260 The special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are
00:02:58.689 actually quite relevant to the way that two-state systems like spin of
00:03:02.269 an electron or the polarization of a photon are described mathematically.
00:03:07.420 What I'll show you here is a way to visualize
00:03:09.703 quaternions in their full four-dimensional glory.
00:03:12.240 It would surprise me if this approach was fully original,
00:03:15.030 but I can say that it's certainly not the standard way to teach quaternions,
00:03:18.800 and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand rule image that I'd like to build up
00:03:23.059 to is something that I haven't seen elsewhere.
00:03:25.880 Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time,
00:03:29.318 but once you have it, there is a very natural and satisfying
00:03:32.152 intuition for how to think about quaternion multiplication.
00:03:35.580 It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions
00:03:39.012 describe orientation in three dimensions, which is for some people the whole
00:03:42.682 reason we care about it, but once we're able to go at it armed with the image
00:03:46.400 of what they're doing to a 4D hypersphere, there's a pleasing understanding
00:03:50.022 to be had for the otherwise opaque formulas characterizing this relationship.
00:03:55.300 The structure here will be to start by imagining teaching complex numbers to
00:03:59.371 someone who only understands one dimension, then describing 3D rotations to
00:04:03.442 someone who only understands two dimensions, and ultimately to represent what
00:04:07.620 quaternions are doing up in four dimensions within the constraints of our 3D space.
00:04:17.040 Our first character is Linus the Linelander, whose mind can only grasp
00:04:20.873 the one-dimensional geometry of lines and the algebra of real numbers.
00:04:25.320 We're going to try to describe complex numbers to Linus,
00:04:27.749 and it's really important for you to empathize with him as much as you can during this,
00:04:31.565 because in a few minutes you're going to be in his shoes.
00:04:34.800 On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically.
00:04:38.640 You say each one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i,
00:04:43.365 where i is a newly invented constant whose defining property
00:04:46.717 is that i times i equals negative one.
00:04:49.340 Then you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers,
00:04:52.794 you just use the distributive property, what many people learn in school as FOIL,
00:04:57.943 and you apply this rule that i times i equals negative one to simplify things
00:05:02.841 down further.
00:05:04.380 And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard textbook way to introduce
00:05:07.989 quaternions is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling it done.
00:05:12.320 But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the geometry of
00:05:16.548 complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like,
00:05:19.512 since the problems in math and physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often
00:05:23.836 leverage this spatial intuition.
00:05:26.200 You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.
00:05:29.180 When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w,
00:05:32.305 you can think of z as a sort of function acting on w,
00:05:35.749 rotating and stretching it in some way.
00:05:40.040 I like to think of this by broadening the view and asking,
00:05:42.533 what does z do to the entire plane?
00:05:44.660 You can think of that bird's eye view action by imagining using one hand to
00:05:48.809 fix the number zero in place, and using another hand to drag the point at one up to z,
00:05:53.623 since anything times zero is zero, and anything times one is itself.
00:05:57.980 In two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching
00:06:00.681 rotating action on the plane that'll do this.
00:06:03.600 This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion multiplication later on,
00:06:07.778 where the number on the left acts as a kind of function to the one on the right,
00:06:11.957 and we'll understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming space,
00:06:16.084 although instead of rotating 2d space, it does a sort of double rotation in 4d space.
00:06:22.900 By the way, if you want to review thinking about complex numbers as a kind of action,
00:06:26.803 a good warmup for this video might be the one I did on e to the
00:06:29.742 pi i explained with introductory group theory.
00:06:32.860 Now Linus the line lander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching,
00:06:36.051 that's what multiplication by real numbers looks like.
00:06:38.900 Maybe it's a little weird for him to think about stretching in multiple dimensions,
00:06:42.343 but it's not fundamentally different.
00:06:44.480 The difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation.
00:06:48.160 Specifically, focus on the unit circle of the complex plane,
00:06:51.673 all the numbers a distance 1 from 0.
00:06:54.040 Since multiplication by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation,
00:06:57.880 how would you explain to Linus the look and feel of multiplying by these numbers?
00:07:04.740 At first, that might seem impossible, rotation is
00:07:07.560 just such an intrinsically two-dimensional idea.
00:07:11.200 But, on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom,
00:07:15.453 a single number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.
00:07:20.100 So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all
00:07:23.890 rotations to the one-dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.
00:07:28.580 And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you
00:07:32.740 is called a stereographic projection, it's a special way to map a circle onto a line,
00:07:37.447 or a sphere into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.
00:07:45.820 For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative 1 through that point,
00:07:50.452 and wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle's center,
00:07:54.582 that's where the point of the circle gets projected.
00:07:59.460 So for example, the point at 1 gets projected into the center of the line,
00:08:04.040 the point i actually stays fixed in place, as does negative i.
00:08:10.260 All of the points on that 90 degree arc between 1 and i will get projected
00:08:14.845 somewhere in the interval between where 1 landed and where i landed.
00:08:20.080 As you continue farther around the circle on the arc between i and negative 1,
00:08:24.304 the projected points end up farther and farther away at an increasing rate.
00:08:29.080 Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative 1,
00:08:32.020 the projected points end up farther and farther on the other end of the line.
00:08:36.300 This line of projected points is what we show to Linus,
00:08:39.643 labeling a few key points, like 1 and i and negative 1 all for reference.
00:08:44.940 Technically, the point at negative 1 has no projection under this map,
00:08:48.258 since the tangent line to the circle at that point never crosses the vertical line.
00:08:52.880 But what we say is that negative 1 ends up at the point at infinity,
00:08:56.399 a special point you imagine adding to the line where you would approach
00:09:00.125 it if you walk infinitely far along the line in either direction.
00:09:04.540 It's important to remember, and remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only
00:09:08.533 the complex numbers that are a distance 1 from the origin, the unit circle.
00:09:13.240 Linus doesn't see most numbers, like 0, or 1 plus i, or negative 2 minus i,
00:09:17.740 but that's okay, because right now we just want to describe complex numbers z where
00:09:22.780 multiplying by z has the effect of a pure rotation,
00:09:25.900 so he only needs to understand the unit circle.
00:09:30.800 For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w,
00:09:35.811 the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise,
00:09:39.112 and when we apply this action to the circle being projected down to the line for Linus,
00:09:44.299 what does he see?
00:09:46.220 Well, it's a bit of a strange morphing action on the line,
00:09:49.056 one which I want you to become familiar with for something we'll see later on.
00:09:52.920 It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points.
00:09:57.460 i times 1 is i, so that means the number 1 should move up to i.
00:10:03.620 i times i is negative 1, so the point at i slides off to infinity.
00:10:11.120 i times negative 1 is equal to negative i, so that point at infinity kind of
00:10:15.348 comes back around from the bottom to the position 1 unit below the center.
00:10:20.120 i times negative i is 1, so the point at negative i slides up to 1.
00:10:26.300 Even though this is kind of a weird motion, it
00:10:28.311 lets us communicate some important ideas to Linus.
00:10:31.100 For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating
00:10:34.802 by 90 degrees four times in a row, gets us back to where we started.
00:10:39.220 i to the fourth equals 1.
00:10:41.400 To get more of a feel for things, let me just show
00:10:43.635 the circle rotated at various different angles,
00:10:46.280 on both the left and right half of the screen.
00:10:48.864 I'm putting a hand on the point that started at the number 1 to help us and help
00:10:53.413 Linus keep track of the overall motion.
00:11:06.340 Next, let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.
00:11:11.220 Imagine trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.
00:11:18.220 In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions,
00:11:21.778 let's extend the complex numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and
00:11:25.920 its vertical axis of imaginary numbers with a third axis,
00:11:29.000 defined by some newly invented constant, j, sitting one unit away from zero,
00:11:33.088 perpendicular to the complex plane.
00:11:35.760 Instead of having this new axis in the z-direction, like you might expect,
00:11:40.033 for a better analogy with how we'll visualize quaternions,
00:11:43.439 we'll want to orient things so that the i and j axes sit in the x and y directions,
00:11:48.289 with the real number line aligned along the z-direction.
00:11:53.500 Every point in 3D space is described as some real number
00:11:57.023 plus some real number times i plus some real number times j.
00:12:01.620 As it happens, it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication
00:12:05.059 for a 3D number system like this that would satisfy the usual
00:12:08.150 algebraic properties that make multiplication a useful construct.
00:12:11.860 Perhaps I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video,
00:12:15.198 but staying focused on our current goal, think about describing
00:12:18.589 3D rotations in this coordinate system to Felix the Flatlander.
00:12:22.620 The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance 1 from
00:12:26.645 0 at the origin, meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is 1.
00:12:34.780 We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is
00:12:38.273 project this 2D surface to him and give him a feel for what
00:12:41.709 reorientations of the sphere look like under that projection.
00:12:46.200 Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will
00:12:49.688 associate almost every point on the unit sphere with a unique
00:12:53.176 point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and the j axes.
00:12:57.380 For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative 1 at the
00:13:01.355 south pole through that point and see where it intersects the plane.
00:13:12.020 So the point 1 at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane.
00:13:15.780 all of the points of the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere
00:13:19.830 inside the unit circle of the i-j plane, and that unit circle which passes through i,
00:13:25.187 j, negative i, negative j, stays fixed in place.
00:13:28.820 And that's an important point to make note of.
00:13:31.100 Even though most points and lines and patches that Felix the Flatlander sees
00:13:35.448 are warped projections of the real sphere, this unit circle is the one thing
00:13:39.852 he has which is an honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered by projection.
00:13:46.700 All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit circle,
00:13:51.180 each getting farther and farther away as you approach negative 1 at the south pole.
00:13:56.460 And again, negative 1 has no projection under this mapping,
00:13:59.561 but what we say is that it ends up at some point at infinity.
00:14:03.520 That point at infinity is something such that no matter which direction you walk
00:14:07.236 on the plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching that point.
00:14:11.430 It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole,
00:14:14.857 you're approaching the south pole.
00:14:18.820 Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions.
00:14:22.920 As I rotate the sphere in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude drawn
00:14:27.770 on that sphere get projected into various circles and lines in Felix's space.
00:14:33.140 And the way I've done things up here, the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the
00:14:37.732 sphere is accurately reflected in the projected view you see with Felix,
00:14:41.723 and the pinker view represents where the point that started at the north pole ends up
00:14:46.424 after the rotation, and the yellow circle represents where the equator ended up after
00:14:51.125 the projection.
00:14:52.980 The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes right now,
00:14:55.460 the easier quaternions will be in a moment, and as with Linus,
00:14:58.408 it helps to focus on a few key reference objects rather than trying
00:15:01.590 to see the whole sphere.
00:15:03.600 This circle, passing through 1, i, negative 1, and negative i,
00:15:07.613 gets mapped onto a line which Felix sees as the horizontal axis.
00:15:12.560 It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the same thing as the i-axis.
00:15:17.120 Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance 1 from the origin,
00:15:22.166 so most points on the actual i-axis, like 0, 2i, 3i, etc.,
00:15:25.752 are completely invisible to Felix.
00:15:30.580 Similarly, the circle that passes through 1, j, negative 1,
00:15:33.962 and negative j gets projected onto what he sees as a vertical line.
00:15:38.400 In general, any line Felix sees comes from some
00:15:41.549 circle on the sphere that passes through negative 1.
00:15:45.840 In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the point at infinity.
00:15:55.120 Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere.
00:15:58.590 A 90 degree rotation about the j-axis brings 1 to i,
00:16:02.503 i to negative 1, negative 1 to negative i, and negative i to 1.
00:16:08.060 So what Felix the Flatlander sees is an extension of
00:16:11.089 the rotation that Linus the Linelander was seeing.
00:16:14.720 Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where the 1,
00:16:20.418 j unit circle used to be.
00:16:22.420 So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed into a vertical line,
00:16:27.389 while the red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.
00:16:32.160 Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion,
00:16:35.552 no actual stretching or morphing is taking place.
00:16:38.320 All of that is just an artifact of the projection.
00:16:42.320 Similarly, a rotation about the i-axis involves moving 1 to j,
00:16:46.503 j to negative 1, negative 1 to negative j, and negative j to 1.
00:16:51.340 This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the 1, i unit circle,
00:16:55.859 which to Felix looks like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.
00:17:09.020 A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand,
00:17:13.226 since the whole projection simply gets rotated about the origin,
00:17:16.730 where the only points staying fixed in place are 1 at the origin and negative 1
00:17:21.043 off at infinity.
00:17:29.030 In the same way that the complex numbers included the real numbers with a single
00:17:33.674 extra quote unquote imaginary dimension, represented by the unit i,
00:17:37.621 and that the not-actually-a-number system thing we had in three dimensions
00:17:41.975 included a second imaginary direction, j, the quaternions include the real
00:17:46.329 numbers together with three separate imaginary dimensions, represented by the units i,
00:17:51.379 j, and k.
00:17:52.620 Each of these three imaginary dimensions is perpendicular to the real number line,
00:17:57.163 and they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.
00:18:01.760 So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers,
00:18:06.192 each quaternion can be written using four real numbers,
00:18:09.218 and it lives in four-dimensional space.
00:18:11.960 You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part,
00:18:15.824 and then a 3D imaginary part.
00:18:18.020 And Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i,
00:18:22.340 j, k components, a word which was previously somewhat foreign
00:18:25.607 in the lingo of math and physics, vector.
00:18:28.900 On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules for
00:18:33.573 how i, j, and k multiply together, and saying that everything must distribute nicely.
00:18:38.590 This is analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i
00:18:42.094 times i is negative 1, and then distributing and simplifying products.
00:18:46.240 And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform quaternion multiplication,
00:18:50.638 and the relative compactness of this operation compared to say matrix multiplication
00:18:54.934 is what's made quaternion so useful for graphics programming and many other things.
00:18:59.880 There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written in terms of
00:19:03.747 the dot product and the cross product, and in some sense,
00:19:06.482 quaternion multiplication subsumes both of these notions,
00:19:09.218 at least as they appear in three dimensions.
00:19:12.460 But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding
00:19:16.615 its geometry that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and
00:19:20.867 rotating, you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion
00:19:24.587 multiplication.
00:19:25.800 And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero,
00:19:29.423 is the square root of the sum of the squares of its component,
00:19:32.683 that same operation gives you the magnitude of a quaternion.
00:19:38.120 And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2,
00:19:41.775 has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude of q1,
00:19:45.573 followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions.
00:19:50.980 And those special 4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand,
00:19:54.954 correspond to the hypersphere of quaternions, a distance 1 from the origin,
00:19:59.149 both in the sense that the quaternions whose multiplying action is a pure
00:20:03.233 rotation live on that hypersphere, and in the sense that we can understand
00:20:07.372 this weird 4D action just by following points on the hypersphere,
00:20:11.015 rather than trying to look at all the points in the inconceivable stretches
00:20:15.210 of four-dimensional space.
00:20:17.280 Analogous to what we did for Linus and Felix, we
00:20:20.078 stereographically project this hypersphere into 3D space.
00:20:27.320 This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion,
00:20:31.705 and this little pink dot will show where that particular quaternion gets projected in
00:20:37.015 our 3D space.
00:20:38.580 Just as before, we're projecting from the number negative 1,
00:20:41.669 which sits on the real number line that is somehow perpendicular to all of our 3D space,
00:20:46.250 and beyond our perception.
00:20:48.340 Just as before, the number 1 ends up projected straight into the center of our space.
00:20:53.740 And in the same way that i and negative i were fixed in place for Linus,
00:20:58.205 and that the ij unit circle was fixed in place for Felix,
00:21:01.801 we get a whole sphere passing through i, j, and k on that unit hypersphere,
00:21:06.514 which stays in place under the projection.
00:21:09.660 So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only unaltered
00:21:14.301 part of the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us.
00:21:18.880 It's something analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere,
00:21:21.970 and it represents all of the unit quaternions whose real part is zero,
00:21:25.959 what Hamilton would have described as unit vectors.
00:21:31.760 The unit quaternions with positive real parts, between 0 and 1,
00:21:35.267 end up somewhere inside this unit sphere, closer to the number 1 in our 3D space,
00:21:39.831 which should feel analogous to how the northern hemisphere got mapped inside the
00:21:44.340 unit circle for Felix.
00:21:47.480 On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with negative
00:21:50.226 real part end up somewhere outside that unit sphere.
00:22:00.100 The number negative 1 is sitting off at the point at infinity,
00:22:03.099 which you can easily find by walking in any direction.
00:22:06.980 Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions
00:22:10.788 as being closer or farther from the origin of our 3D space,
00:22:13.794 everything you're looking at represents a unit quaternion,
00:22:16.750 so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude,
00:22:19.906 the same distance from the number 0.
00:22:22.520 And that number 0 itself is nowhere to be found in this picture.
00:22:26.160 Like all other non-unit quaternions, it's invisible to us.
00:22:30.820 In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through 1, i, negative 1,
00:22:35.408 and negative i got projected into a line through the origin,
00:22:39.091 when we see this line through the origin passing through i and negative i,
00:22:43.619 we should understand that it really represents a circle.
00:22:47.580 Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us,
00:22:50.653 there is a unit sphere passing through 1, i, j, negative 1, negative i,
00:22:55.170 and negative j, and that whole sphere gets projected into the plane that we see
00:23:00.188 passing through 1, i, negative i, j, negative j, and negative 1, off at infinity,
00:23:05.331 what you and I might call the xy plane.
00:23:08.580 In general, any plane that you see here really represents the projection of a
00:23:12.574 sphere somewhere up on the hypersphere which passes through the number negative 1.
00:23:19.180 The action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion from
00:23:24.129 the left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2D rotations,
00:23:27.927 happening perpendicular to and in sync with each other in a way that could only ever be
00:23:32.991 possible in four dimensions.
00:23:35.480 As a first example, let's look at multiplication by i.
00:23:38.720 We already know what this does to the circle that passes through 1 and i,
00:23:42.679 which we see as a line.
00:23:45.840 1 goes to i, i goes to negative 1, off at infinity,
00:23:50.122 negative 1 comes back around to negative i, and negative i goes to 1.
00:23:56.700 Remember, just like what Linus saw, all of this is
00:23:59.373 the stereographic projection of a 90 degree rotation.
00:24:03.120 Now look at the circle passing through j and k,
00:24:05.705 which is in a sense perpendicular to the circle passing through 1 and i.
00:24:10.280 It might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular to each other,
00:24:14.071 especially when they have the same center and radius and don't touch each other at all,
00:24:18.241 but nothing could be more natural in four dimensions.
00:24:21.640 You can think of the action of i on this perpendicular circle as obeying
00:24:25.480 a certain right-hand rule, if you'll excuse the intrusion of my ghostly
00:24:29.320 green-screen hand into our otherwise pristine platonic mathematical stage.
00:24:33.700 You let that thumb of your right hand point from the number 1 to i,
00:24:37.392 and you curl your fingers.
00:24:39.400 The j-k circle will rotate in the direction of that curl.
00:24:43.660 How much?
00:24:44.600 Well, by the same amount as the 1i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case.
00:24:50.560 This is what I meant by two rotations perpendicular to and in sync with each other.
00:24:55.480 So j goes to k, k goes to negative j, negative j goes to negative k,
00:25:05.043 and negative k goes to j.
00:25:10.820 This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions,
00:25:14.545 but I want this not to be something that you memorize,
00:25:17.075 but something that you could close your eyes and you could really see.
00:25:21.340 Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers 1, i, j, and k,
00:25:26.213 you know what it does to any arbitrary quaternion,
00:25:29.244 since multiplication distributes nicely.
00:25:32.240 In the language of linear algebra, 1, i, j, and k form a basis of our
00:25:36.299 4-dimensional space, so knowing what our transformation does to them
00:25:40.358 gives us the full information about what it does to all of space.
00:25:45.220 Geometrically, a 4-dimensional creature would be able to look at those
00:25:48.931 two perpendicular rotations I just described,
00:25:51.369 and understand that they lock you into one and only one rigid motion for the hypersphere.
00:25:56.620 We might lack the intuitions of such a hypothetical creature,
00:25:59.543 but we can maybe try to get close.
00:26:01.680 Here's what the action of repeatedly multiplying by i looks
00:26:05.302 like on our stereographic projection of the ijk sphere.
00:26:09.560 It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it
00:26:14.266 used to be, though the orientation is reversed now,
00:26:17.079 then gets rotated again into what we see as a plane, and after the fourth iteration,
00:26:21.676 it ends up right back where it started.
00:26:25.040 As another example, think of a quaternion like q equals negative square root of
00:26:30.208 2 over 2 plus square root of 2 over 2 times i,
00:26:33.283 which if we pull up a picture of a complex plane,
00:26:36.555 is a 135 degree rotation away from 1 in the direction of i.
00:26:41.110 Under our projection, we see this along the line
00:26:43.854 from 1 to i somewhere outside the unit sphere.
00:26:47.260 If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.
00:26:51.660 The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us
00:26:56.389 like dragging the point at 1 all the way to this projected version of q,
00:27:01.118 while the jk circle gets rotated 135 degrees, according to our right-hand rule.
00:27:09.980 Multiplication by any other quaternion is completely similar.
00:27:13.740 For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act
00:27:16.150 on other quaternions by multiplication from the left.
00:27:19.360 The circle through 1 and j, which we see projected as a line through the origin,
00:27:25.239 gets rotated 90 degrees, dragging 1 up to j, so j times 1 is 1 and j times j is negative
00:27:31.780 1.
00:27:38.060 The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k,
00:27:43.263 gets rotated 90 degrees according to this right-hand rule,
00:27:48.215 where you point your thumb from 1 to j, so j times i is negative k, and j times k is i.
00:28:01.740 In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space,
00:28:05.784 start by drawing the unit circle passing through 1, q, and negative 1,
00:28:09.945 which we see in our projection as a line through the origin.
00:28:14.220 Then draw the circle perpendicular to that 1 on what we see as the unit sphere.
00:28:18.900 You rotate the first circle so that 1 ends up where q was,
00:28:22.356 and rotate the perpendicular circle by the same amount according to the right-hand rule.
00:28:40.120 One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters.
00:28:43.920 It's not, as mathematicians would say, commutative.
00:28:47.280 For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of
00:28:51.813 i acting on the quaternion j, rotating it up to k,
00:28:55.370 but if you think of j as acting on i, j times i, it rotates i to negative k.
00:29:01.740 In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication,
00:29:05.390 is a way more special property than a lot of people realize.
00:29:09.080 And most groups of actions on some space don't have it.
00:29:12.740 It's like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot,
00:29:16.406 or how rotating a cube about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives
00:29:20.732 a different final state from rotating it about the x-axis, then about the z-axis.
00:29:29.300 And last, as one final but rather important point,
00:29:31.910 so far I've shown you how to think about quaternions as acting by left multiplication,
00:29:36.451 where when you read an expression like i times j,
00:29:39.061 you think of i as a kind of function morphing all of space,
00:29:42.193 and j is just one of the points that it's acting on.
00:29:44.960 But you can also think of them as a different sort of action,
00:29:48.414 by multiplying from the right, where in this expression, j would be acting on i.
00:29:53.680 In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar.
00:29:56.940 It's still the case that 1 goes to j, and j goes to negative 1,
00:30:00.467 etc., but instead of applying the right-hand rule to the circle
00:30:04.049 perpendicular to the 1j circle, you would use your left hand.
00:30:08.100 So either way, i times j is equal to k, but you can either think about this with
00:30:13.517 your right hand curling the number j to the number k as your thumb points from 1 to i,
00:30:19.408 or as your left hand curling i to k as its thumb points from 1 to j.
00:30:24.920 Understanding this left-hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be
00:30:29.299 extremely useful for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three
00:30:33.843 dimensions.
00:30:35.640 And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3D rotation.
00:30:41.100 I mean, if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i,
00:30:45.137 j, and k, it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position.
00:30:49.500 So the way that this works is slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product.
00:30:53.840 It involves a process called conjugation, and I'll make a full follow-on
00:30:57.187 video all about it so that we have the time to go through some examples.
00:31:02.020 In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation
00:31:06.089 to orientation in 3D space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you
00:31:10.206 are familiar with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video.
