Title: The-285B-Sell-Off-Was-Just-the-Beginning-The-Infrastructure-Story-Is-Bigger.
00:00:00.160 The most interesting thing about
00:00:01.360 OpenClaw is not the agent, it's the web.
00:00:04.560 The web is forking in the age of agents,
00:00:07.279 and nobody's talking about it enough.
00:00:09.040 Last Tuesday, three things happened
00:00:11.120 within hours of each other. Coinbase
00:00:12.960 launched Agentic Wallets, which are
00:00:14.639 crypto wallets designed not for people,
00:00:16.720 but for agents. Cloudflare shipped
00:00:18.640 Markdown for agents, a feature that
00:00:20.320 automatically converts any website into
00:00:22.400 agent readable markdown when an AI
00:00:24.480 system requests it. And then OpenAI
00:00:26.480 published a developer blog post about
00:00:28.080 skills and shell tools that let agents
00:00:30.160 install software dependencies, run
00:00:31.920 scripts, and write files inside hosted
00:00:34.079 containers. None of these companies
00:00:36.239 coordinated their announcements. They
00:00:38.239 didn't need to. They're all building
00:00:40.399 toward the same future. They all see the
00:00:43.040 open claw phenomenon, and that future is
00:00:45.440 arriving faster than any of them or most
00:00:47.840 of us expected. In the last few videos,
00:00:50.320 I've covered Open Claw's chaotic launch,
00:00:52.719 the emergent behaviors that made
00:00:54.399 researchers rethink agent capability and
00:00:57.039 what thousands of community-built skills
00:00:59.680 reveal about what people actually want
00:01:01.840 from their AI agents. This video is
00:01:04.239 about something bigger than Open Claw.
00:01:06.320 It's about the infrastructure layer
00:01:08.080 that's forming under it and underneath
00:01:10.400 every agent that comes after it. It's
00:01:12.560 about a new kind of web. Every major
00:01:15.119 infrastructure company on the internet
00:01:16.799 is now simultaneously building a
00:01:19.439 different piece of what amounts to an
00:01:21.439 entirely new way for commerce and
00:01:24.400 interaction to get done across the
00:01:26.080 internet. And those pieces are snapping
00:01:28.080 together faster than most of our mental
00:01:30.400 models can track. Let's start with the
00:01:32.159 money. Agents can't do much on the web
00:01:33.840 if they can't pay for things. Coinbase's
00:01:35.840 Agentic Wallet solved this on the crypto
00:01:38.000 side using a protocol called X42 that's
00:01:41.119 already processed over 50 million
00:01:43.360 machineto-achine transactions. Yes, you
00:01:45.840 heard that right, 50 million. The
00:01:47.600 wallets come with programmable spending
00:01:49.520 limits, session caps, and gasless
00:01:51.439 trading on Coinbase's base network.
00:01:53.119 developers can spin one up in under 2
00:01:55.200 minutes with a command line tool. And
00:01:56.560 the wallets use non-custodial
00:01:58.159 architecture, which means that even if
00:01:59.920 the agent is compromised, the keys
00:02:02.320 themselves sit in secure hardware that
00:02:05.040 the agent cannot access. So the agent
00:02:07.119 can't leak those keys. Within 24 hours
00:02:10.160 of this launch,
00:02:12.239 new AI agents registered wallets on
00:02:14.720 Ethereum. That's not developer
00:02:16.560 experimentation. That's an ecosystem of
00:02:19.040 agents with wallets forming in real
00:02:21.680 time. The use cases that Coinbase
00:02:23.520 highlighted tell you where Coinbase
00:02:25.599 thinks this is going. Agents that
00:02:27.360 autonomously rebalance DeFi portfolios,
00:02:30.400 agents that pay for API calls as they
00:02:32.800 make them. Agents that purchase compute
00:02:35.040 on demand and participate in creator
00:02:37.040 economies. Brian Armstrong's pitch is
00:02:39.599 quote, "The next generation of agents
00:02:41.360 won't just advise, they'll act." Which,
00:02:43.519 like, duh, that's what Open Claw is all
00:02:45.599 about. But this is clearly where he's
00:02:47.280 going. What he did not say is that the
00:02:49.360 architecture implies that agents with
00:02:51.519 wallets will become real economic
00:02:53.599 entities, that can earn, that can spend,
00:02:56.319 and that accumulate capital
00:02:58.239 independently of the humans who created
00:03:00.560 them. That's a category of software that
00:03:03.200 has never existed before. And that is a
00:03:05.360 whole mess of legal problems that we
00:03:07.120 have not encountered yet. Stripe is
00:03:08.879 solving the same problem on the
00:03:10.400 traditional payment side. Their Aenta
00:03:12.480 Commerce suite, which was launched in
00:03:14.000 December, allows businesses to connect a
00:03:16.560 product catalog and start selling
00:03:18.319 through AI agents with a single
00:03:20.159 integration. They built a new payment
00:03:22.400 primitive called shared payment tokens,
00:03:25.280 scoped, time constrained credentials
00:03:28.000 that let an agent initiate a purchase
00:03:30.239 using a buyer saved payment method
00:03:32.640 without ever seeing the card number.
00:03:34.640 Stripe's fraud detection system, radar,
00:03:36.720 had to be retrained from scratch because
00:03:39.519 the old signals were all calibrated for
00:03:42.239 human shopping behavior. Think about
00:03:44.720 what that means. Decades of fraud
00:03:46.799 detection machine learning built on
00:03:48.720 patterns like mouse movement
00:03:50.319 variability, browsing time, session
00:03:53.120 behavior, device fingerprinting, all of
00:03:56.000 it became useless when the buyer is
00:03:59.840 software. Agent traffic doesn't move a
00:04:02.159 mouse. It doesn't browse. It doesn't
00:04:04.319 exhibit the behavioral variability that
00:04:06.480 distinguishes a legitimate shopper from
00:04:08.400 a bot. Stripe had to build an entirely
00:04:10.879 new fraud model for a client that is by
00:04:13.280 any prior definition a bot. And yet now
00:04:16.320 bots are purchasers. Brands including
00:04:18.479 Urban, Etsy, Coach, Kate Spade, and
00:04:20.959 Revolve are all already onboarding.
00:04:23.520 Google is getting in on the action, too.
00:04:25.040 They launched their agent payments
00:04:26.800 protocol back in September. PayPal and
00:04:28.960 OpenAI partnered on instant checkout in
00:04:31.120 chat GPT. Visa built a trusted agent
00:04:33.600 protocol at NRF 2026 which is a
00:04:36.400 conference for this in January. Google
00:04:38.320 announced the universal commerce
00:04:39.840 protocol which is an open standard for
00:04:41.600 agent to commerce interaction and
00:04:43.440 Stripe's ACS immediately auto supports
00:04:46.000 it meaning merchants who integrated
00:04:47.600 Stripe's agent tools are already
00:04:49.600 compatible with Google's agent shopping
00:04:51.759 infrastructure without writing one more
00:04:53.600 line of code. The industry consensus, as
00:04:55.840 a decrypt analyst put it, is quote,
00:04:57.759 "Agents that can't spend money are
00:04:59.520 fundamentally limited," which is true,
00:05:02.000 but there's a whole lot down the road
00:05:03.680 once you do that. Nevertheless, every
00:05:06.400 major payment company reached this
00:05:08.160 conclusion independently within the same
00:05:10.320 couple of month window. But we're not
00:05:12.000 done when we're talking about payments.
00:05:13.600 Let's go over to content access. The web
00:05:15.919 is made of HTML, and HTML is designed
00:05:18.720 for human browsers, not language models.
00:05:21.520 pages are bloated with scripts, tracking
00:05:23.840 pixels, navigation menus, and ads. When
00:05:26.400 an agent needs to read a web page, it
00:05:29.120 has to strip all of that stuff that we
00:05:30.880 humans like out of the way and convert
00:05:32.720 it into something useful. Usually,
00:05:34.479 that's markdown. This is such a common
00:05:36.639 step that an entire category of
00:05:38.560 companies like Firecrawl or Exa exists
00:05:41.360 just to do that conversion. Now,
00:05:43.759 Cloudflare's Markdown for agents cuts
00:05:46.000 out that middleman. When an AI agent
00:05:47.919 requests a page for any Cloudflare
00:05:50.240 enabled site, it sends an accept header
00:05:53.120 and Cloudflare intercepts the request,
00:05:55.360 fetches the HTML from the origin server,
00:05:57.680 converts it to markdown on the fly, and
00:06:00.080 serves it back. The response even
00:06:02.400 includes an X markdown tokens header
00:06:04.880 with the estimated token count, so the
00:06:07.199 agent can manage its own context window.
00:06:10.000 No scraping anymore, no conversion
00:06:12.080 libraries, no wasted compute. The agent
00:06:15.039 just asks for markdown and gets
00:06:17.440 markdown. This matters a lot more than
00:06:19.680 it might sound. Cloudflare serves
00:06:21.759 roughly 20% of the web. when they decide
00:06:24.960 agents are first class citizens of the
00:06:27.440 web, which is what they just did. When
00:06:29.600 they decide agents are not to be
00:06:31.360 blocked, but rather clients who should
00:06:33.520 be served in their preferred format,
00:06:35.280 markdown, Cloudflare is making an
00:06:38.080 infrastructure level commitment to a
00:06:40.639 world where software reads websites as
00:06:43.520 routinely as humans do. And Cloudflare
00:06:46.160 isn't stopping at markdown conversion.
00:06:48.240 They launched three companion features
00:06:50.639 in the same release. First, LLM.ext text
00:06:53.360 and LLM's full.ext, which are
00:06:55.280 standardized machine readable site maps
00:06:57.440 that tell agents what's on a site and
00:06:59.599 how to navigate it. Just like robots.ext
00:07:02.800 told search engine crawlers the exact
00:07:04.800 same thing two decades ago. Second,
00:07:07.680 Cloudflare launched AI index. It's an
00:07:10.080 opt-in search index where sites can make
00:07:12.319 their content discoverable to agents
00:07:14.479 directly through Cloudflare's MCP server
00:07:16.960 and search API. And that means they can
00:07:19.440 bypass Google entirely. Third and most
00:07:22.400 telling, Cloudflare is including builtin
00:07:25.280 X42 monetization support. So site owners
00:07:28.639 can charge agents for content access
00:07:31.520 using the exact same protocol as
00:07:34.880 Coinbase's wallets. Cloudflare isn't
00:07:37.440 just making the web readable for agents.
00:07:39.840 They're building an economic layer for a
00:07:42.240 web where agents pay to access content.
00:07:45.360 Then there's search. Google search is
00:07:47.440 optimized for humans, obviously. 10 blue
00:07:49.599 links, ads, featured snippets, knowledge
00:07:52.000 panels. Recently, they added AI
00:07:53.759 summaries. None of that is useful to an
00:07:56.080 agent that needs to programmatically
00:07:58.479 find specific information and then come
00:08:00.639 back with structured data. Exa.ai built
00:08:03.039 a search engine from scratch
00:08:04.479 specifically for agents, their own
00:08:06.319 index, their own neural retrieval
00:08:08.160 models, their own embedding
00:08:09.440 infrastructure. Their API returns raw
00:08:12.000 URLs and content, not search engine
00:08:14.400 result pages. Their research endpoint
00:08:16.639 chains multiple searches together.
00:08:18.400 agentically parallelizing across output
00:08:20.879 fields to minimize latency. It scores
00:08:23.520 95% on simple QA, a benchmark for
00:08:26.639 factual accuracy. For comparison,
00:08:29.120 perplexity scores lower. So, if you're
00:08:31.199 thinking, is this going to be a new bar
00:08:33.279 for accurate agentic search? You would
00:08:35.440 be right. But the benchmark results are
00:08:37.599 much less interesting than what this is
00:08:39.599 all implying about the future of
00:08:41.519 internet market structures. Google built
00:08:43.760 a search engine for humans and spent
00:08:45.839 decades perfecting it. Now there's a
00:08:48.160 parallel need search for machines and
00:08:50.800 Google's architecture is the wrong shape
00:08:53.760 for that. The companies that build agent
00:08:56.080 native search from first principles have
00:08:58.720 an actual structural advantage, not just
00:09:01.200 a marketing one. An independent
00:09:03.279 benchmark from AI multiple tested the
00:09:05.600 major agent search providers
00:09:07.120 head-to-head. If search led on a
00:09:09.360 composite agent score, Firecrawl, Exa,
00:09:11.600 and Parallel Pro were statistically tied
00:09:13.920 behind it. But the latency spread tells
00:09:16.160 you where the real differentiation is
00:09:17.839 starting to live. In an agent workflow,
00:09:20.320 Brave returned results in 669
00:09:22.560 milliseconds, which is about 2/3 of a
00:09:24.880 second. Parallel Pro took 13.6
00:09:29.120 whole seconds. In an agent workflow
00:09:31.680 where each search is one step in a long
00:09:34.320 chain, that latency difference compounds
00:09:37.120 into minutes really, really fast. The
00:09:39.600 providers that own their own
00:09:41.120 infrastructure and their own agentic
00:09:43.279 index rather than wrapping Google's API
00:09:45.839 have a structural speed advantage that
00:09:48.320 grows much more valuable as agent
00:09:50.399 workflows get more complex. And guess
00:09:52.399 what? They're going to in 2026. And then
00:09:54.880 there's execution. Openai's blog post on
00:09:57.120 skills, shell, and compaction reads like
00:09:59.360 a road map for turning agents into
00:10:01.600 advisors and workers. Skills are
00:10:04.399 reusable version instruction bundles.
00:10:06.160 We've heard about them from Claude
00:10:07.440 before. I've talked about them a fair
00:10:09.040 bit. Think of them as standard operating
00:10:11.120 procedures for AI for a particular task.
00:10:13.519 An agent can load them on demand,
00:10:15.279 immediately learn the skill, and get
00:10:16.640 going. The shell tool gives agents a
00:10:19.120 real terminal environment where they can
00:10:20.880 install dependencies, run scripts, and
00:10:23.360 write output files. Compaction manages
00:10:25.680 the context window automatically so that
00:10:27.760 longunning agent workflows don't crash
00:10:30.640 when they hit token limits. The details
00:10:32.720 matter here because they reveal OpenAI's
00:10:34.880 bet about what agent architecture
00:10:36.959 actually is going to look like in
00:10:38.880 production. Skills aren't prompts.
00:10:41.519 They're versioned. They're mountable
00:10:43.200 instruction packages. They look more
00:10:45.040 like Docker images than chat templates.
00:10:47.440 An organization can build a Salesforce
00:10:49.760 skill, test it, lock down the version,
00:10:51.920 and deploy it across every agent in the
00:10:53.920 company with a guarantee that every
00:10:55.680 agent follows the same procedure. When
00:10:58.079 the procedure changes, you just update
00:11:00.000 that skill version and every single
00:11:02.399 agent will follow. You don't have to
00:11:03.920 mess with CIS prompts or anything else.
00:11:05.920 That's the difference between arteasonal
00:11:07.760 prompt engineering and actual software
00:11:10.160 engineering applied to AI operations.
00:11:12.720 The shell tool is equally telling. It
00:11:14.720 gives agents a real Linux environment,
00:11:16.959 not a sandbox playground, but a terminal
00:11:19.519 where they can write files to disk and
00:11:21.680 type commands like install, curl, and
00:11:24.000 grap. The pattern OpenAI describes
00:11:26.720 installing dependencies, fetching
00:11:28.480 external data, producing a real
00:11:30.079 deliverable that is functionally
00:11:32.399 identical to how a human freelancer
00:11:35.040 works today. Human freelancers read the
00:11:37.360 brief, set up the tools, do the
00:11:39.440 research, and deliver the artifact. So
00:11:41.920 do agents. The difference is the agent
00:11:44.399 can now do it inside a container in just
00:11:46.720 a few seconds. And skills ensure that it
00:11:49.440 follows the same procedure every single
00:11:52.160 time. Glean is an enterprise search
00:11:54.079 company and it was an early skills
00:11:55.920 customer and they saw accuracy on
00:11:58.000 Salesforce related tasks jump from 73 to
00:12:01.040 85% with a single well ststructured
00:12:03.519 skill. At the same time it got faster
00:12:05.920 because the agent wasn't thinking about
00:12:07.440 what to do and they saw about an 18%
00:12:09.680 decrease in time to first token which
00:12:12.240 matters when every single query counts.
00:12:15.200 The gains come from moving stable
00:12:17.360 procedures out of system prompt and into
00:12:19.600 versioned modular instruction bundles
00:12:22.000 which is frankly again just software
00:12:24.399 engineering applied to AI workflows.
00:12:26.959 We're not reinventing the wheel here.
00:12:28.720 Nothing revolutionary. Everything that
00:12:30.480 is revolutionary comes from second order
00:12:32.800 effects. All we're doing is a classic
00:12:35.120 enterprise deployment except we're doing
00:12:37.519 it with AI. We now have version control,
00:12:40.000 testing, roll back. That part isn't new.
00:12:42.880 The part that's new is that we're doing
00:12:44.959 all of this for autonomous AI agents.
00:12:47.040 Last but not least, they launched
00:12:48.720 compaction, which is not a particularly
00:12:50.880 flashy feature, but which is super
00:12:52.959 important to support longunning
00:12:54.399 workflows. Any agent running for a while
00:12:56.720 accumulates pages of search results, API
00:12:59.279 responses, calculations, conversation
00:13:01.600 history, and the context window gets
00:13:03.600 dirty. It fills up. The agent starts to
00:13:06.000 forget earlier steps or drift. The agent
00:13:08.160 may crash. Compaction handles all of
00:13:10.639 this server side and automatically
00:13:13.120 summarizes and compresses the context to
00:13:15.360 keep the agent operational across
00:13:17.040 workflows that would otherwise be
00:13:18.480 impossible. It's the kind of feature
00:13:20.480 that makes agents viable for tasks that
00:13:23.200 take longer, like hours instead of just
00:13:25.440 a few minutes. And that kind of
00:13:27.040 sustained multi-step work at scale
00:13:29.519 redefineses how easily you can roll out
00:13:32.399 agents across an enterprise environment.
00:13:34.399 So let's step back. What happens when
00:13:36.560 you combine all of the different
00:13:38.240 primitives I have been talking about
00:13:40.079 here? An agent that has a wallet, search
00:13:42.880 capabilities, content access, payment
00:13:45.279 rails, and an execution environment is
00:13:47.680 more than an assistant. It is an
00:13:50.000 economic actor. Consider what a
00:13:52.240 developer calling himself chat app
00:13:54.800 demonstrated on X this week. He
00:13:56.800 connected OpenClaw to Cance 2.0, which
00:13:59.440 is a video generation model inside an
00:14:01.760 app called Chatcut. Then he sent the
00:14:03.920 agent an Amazon product link. The agent
00:14:06.320 crawled the Amazon page, extracted
00:14:08.480 product info and photos, identified
00:14:11.199 which assets were suitable for video
00:14:13.360 generation, fed them into seed dance,
00:14:15.680 which is an incredible video model, and
00:14:17.920 produced a userenerated content style
00:14:20.480 product video. The kind of content that
00:14:22.959 brands pay creators a,000 bucks to
00:14:25.680 produce. No human touched any step
00:14:28.639 between paste this link and here's your
00:14:30.959 video. I watched it. It looks pretty
00:14:33.120 good. That is the emergent web. Not
00:14:35.440 agent doing a task, but agents chaining
00:14:38.320 capabilities together across services to
00:14:41.199 produce outputs that previously required
00:14:44.160 multiple humans and multiple tools. The
00:14:46.560 Amazon page wasn't designed for agents.
00:14:49.920 Cance 2.0 actually wasn't designed to
00:14:52.560 receive input from web crawlers. Chatcut
00:14:55.279 wasn't designed as an orchestration
00:14:57.360 layer, but because each piece exposes
00:15:00.079 its capabilities through APIs and
00:15:02.320 structured data, the agent can
00:15:03.910 [clears throat] stitch them together
00:15:04.880 into a workflow that no individual
00:15:07.600 company planned. This is the pattern
00:15:09.920 that the infrastructure convergence
00:15:11.920 makes inevitable. When content is
00:15:14.000 available as markdown, search returns
00:15:16.320 structured data, execution happens in
00:15:18.560 containers, and payment flows through
00:15:20.399 tokenized protocols. So the agent
00:15:22.880 doesn't need anybody to build an
00:15:24.480 integration between A and B. It can read
00:15:26.880 both services, understand both, and
00:15:29.040 chain them together on the fly. The
00:15:31.040 emergent web is therefore not a platform
00:15:33.519 that any one person is going to build.
00:15:35.680 It's what happens automatically when the
00:15:38.480 primitives exist and the agent is smart
00:15:40.720 enough to combine them together. And the
00:15:42.720 agents increasingly are. The
00:15:44.560 implications for the creator economy
00:15:46.560 alone are staggering. The UGC product
00:15:49.440 video would have cost, you know, a
00:15:50.959 thousand bucks and the agent can
00:15:52.800 replicate that workflow from one link,
00:15:54.880 not maybe with human creative judgment,
00:15:56.800 but at a cost that approaches zero and a
00:15:59.120 turnaround time measured in a couple of
00:16:00.800 minutes. If you multiply that by every
00:16:03.120 content type that follows a repeatable
00:16:05.120 pattern, like product descriptions,
00:16:06.880 social media posts, email campaigns,
00:16:09.519 comparison articles, you start to see
00:16:12.160 why the infrastructure companies are
00:16:14.000 building for a scale that isn't there
00:16:15.440 yet. They are seeing a world where this
00:16:18.320 kind of emergent agent behavior is the
00:16:21.600 norm, the default, not just a weird demo
00:16:24.399 from a guy on X. Poly Market provides
00:16:26.800 the most provocative case study of where
00:16:28.560 this goes. The prediction market
00:16:30.560 platform processed $12 billion in volume
00:16:34.160 in January 2026 alone. Researchers from
00:16:37.040 IMDIA Networks Institute analyzed 86
00:16:40.240 million bets and found that algorithmic
00:16:42.160 traders extracted roughly $40 million in
00:16:45.519 arbitrage profits over a 12-month
00:16:47.600 period. The top three wallets placed
00:16:49.680 over $10,000 bets combined. Only half a%
00:16:53.440 of all Poly Market users earned more
00:16:56.000 than $1,000. The rest were effectively
00:16:59.040 just providing liquidity for bots to
00:17:01.519 extract value. And here's where it gets
00:17:03.759 even more interesting. Poly Market
00:17:05.679 itself tweeted in early February of this
00:17:08.240 year that quote autonomous AI agents are
00:17:11.360 now trading on Poly Market in an attempt
00:17:14.240 to subsidize their token costs. Agents
00:17:16.720 are trying to earn money to pay for
00:17:18.799 their own compute. The loop is closing.
00:17:21.520 Meanwhile, the data on how well agents
00:17:23.520 are doing is mixed but illuminating.
00:17:25.919 OLAS protocols Poly Strat agents among
00:17:28.160 the most sophisticated autonomous
00:17:30.480 prediction market systems that are being
00:17:32.080 publicly tracked achieve maybe 55 to 65%
00:17:35.919 win rates over time with performance
00:17:37.520 varying really dramatically by domain.
00:17:39.440 Agents tend to be better at predicting
00:17:41.120 things that follow from data rather than
00:17:43.039 things that follow from culture, which
00:17:44.559 is not surprising. It tells you the kind
00:17:46.480 of economic activity that agents are
00:17:48.320 really well suited for versus the kind
00:17:49.919 that maybe humans are well suited for.
00:17:51.840 I'm not sure we'll see an agent doing
00:17:53.440 the Met Gala anytime soon. The
00:17:55.600 cumulative volume of AI trades on Poly
00:17:58.640 Market is continuing to grow. It's just
00:18:01.120 going to when you have AI agents by the
00:18:03.200 thousand registering for wallets and
00:18:05.600 trying to start getting into currency.
00:18:07.600 This is where the scam also lives. The
00:18:09.360 talk right now is flooded with videos of
00:18:11.520 people claiming to turn, I don't know,
00:18:13.200 50 bucks into 3,000 bucks in a couple of
00:18:15.280 days. These videos get thousands of
00:18:17.200 likes. These videos get thousands of
00:18:19.200 bookmarks. People are clearly hungry for
00:18:22.320 the words AI and make money in the same
00:18:24.799 video. The reality is considerably less
00:18:27.679 glamorous. The bot that famously turned
00:18:30.080 $313 into $438,000
00:18:33.600 in a month was running latency
00:18:36.160 arbitrage, exploiting a millisecond gap
00:18:38.640 between when Bitcoin moved on Binance
00:18:40.799 and when Polyarket odds adjusted. That
00:18:43.120 kind of algorithmic trading is not what
00:18:45.440 your open claw bot is going to be able
00:18:47.440 to do. That is highfrequency trading
00:18:49.520 which has been known in finance circles
00:18:51.840 for a long time and is just being
00:18:53.840 applied to poly market as the market
00:18:55.600 matures. It requires really fancy setups
00:18:58.799 like colllocated infrastructure with sub
00:19:00.960 10 millisecond latency. It requires
00:19:03.200 capital that is a whole lot larger than
00:19:05.039 any Tik Tok video would suggest. And if
00:19:07.440 you try and do it with something like an
00:19:09.840 openclaw agent, you're going to run into
00:19:12.000 real costs. One developer who actually
00:19:14.480 built and tested an autonomous
00:19:16.240 polymarket agent reported that
00:19:17.919 Cloudflare blocks API requests from data
00:19:20.559 center IPs and requires custom bypass
00:19:23.200 infrastructure just to place orders.
00:19:25.440 Another one found that running the bot
00:19:26.960 for just a couple of days racked up 200
00:19:29.200 bucks in API fees alone. So yes,
00:19:32.400 sophisticated autonomous trading agents
00:19:34.799 can generate returns on Poly Market. No,
00:19:38.160 you cannot replicate this with your open
00:19:40.400 claw by feeding it a Tik Tok tutorial.
00:19:43.039 The infrastructure requirements, the API
00:19:45.360 costs, and the competitive dynamics make
00:19:47.360 this a game for well- capitalized tech
00:19:49.600 operators, not retail experimenters. But
00:19:52.240 the underlying premise, the thing we've
00:19:54.240 been talking about all video, the idea
00:19:56.000 that agents can participate in economic
00:19:58.400 activity and generate revenue, that is
00:20:00.720 not a scam. That is the direction that
00:20:02.799 Coinbase, Stripe, Google, PayPal, Visa,
00:20:05.520 and OpenAI are all aggressively building
00:20:07.840 toward simultaneously with billions of
00:20:10.799 dollars in infrastructure investment.
00:20:12.720 The question isn't whether agents will
00:20:14.960 be able to transact autonomously. The
00:20:17.039 question is whether guardrails will be
00:20:18.640 built fast enough to prevent very
00:20:21.520 predictable disasters. I covered
00:20:23.840 openclaw security nightmare in detail in
00:20:26.000 my first video. The one-click remote
00:20:28.400 code execution, malicious skills
00:20:30.480 disguised as crypto tools, Cisco's
00:20:32.799 research team finding data xfiltration
00:20:34.880 in a third party skill. I'm not going to
00:20:36.960 rehash all of that. What I want to focus
00:20:39.120 on instead is the structural problem
00:20:41.440 that those incidents illustrate because
00:20:43.280 it scales with the infrastructure for
00:20:45.600 agent commerce. Every primitive that
00:20:47.840 makes agents more capable also makes
00:20:50.320 them more dangerous. An agent with a
00:20:52.320 wallet can pay for APIs or get drained
00:20:54.720 by a malicious skill. An agent with
00:20:56.480 shell access can install dependencies or
00:20:58.880 execute arbitrary code injected through
00:21:00.799 a prompt. An agent with search can find
00:21:03.600 information or be redirected to
00:21:06.000 adversarial content designed to
00:21:08.159 manipulate his behavior. And last but
00:21:10.080 not least, an agent with Cloudflare
00:21:11.840 served Markdown can read websites or
00:21:14.480 consume poison content at machine speed.
00:21:16.720 It's kind of your choice. The security
00:21:19.039 community is already responding to the
00:21:21.440 threats that come with these new
00:21:23.039 primitives. And the responses are
00:21:24.880 instructive because they reveal what
00:21:26.559 serious people think the real attack
00:21:28.480 surface is going to look like for
00:21:29.919 agents. Ironclaw is a rustbased
00:21:32.320 re-implementation of OpenClaw by near.ai
00:21:35.679 co-founder Ilia Polosukin and it
00:21:38.159 sandboxes every single tool that
00:21:40.240 OpenClaw uses into isolated web assembly
00:21:43.280 environments. Assumption being that any
00:21:45.600 tool an agent touches is a potential
00:21:47.840 compromise vector. OpenAI's shell tool
00:21:50.159 meanwhile includes org level and request
00:21:52.400 level network allow lists, domain
00:21:54.480 secrets that prevent credential leakage
00:21:56.240 and container isolation. The assumption
00:21:58.480 being that agents will run untrusted
00:22:00.799 code and the environment must contain
00:22:02.720 the blast radius. Coinbase's agentic
00:22:05.120 wallets use enclave isolation for
00:22:07.200 private keys and programmable spending
00:22:09.440 guardrails. The assumption there being
00:22:11.360 that the agent itself cannot be fully
00:22:13.679 trusted with the assets it manages.
00:22:15.760 Notice the pattern across all of these.
00:22:18.000 Every serious security approach treats
00:22:20.799 the agent as a potential adversary. That
00:22:23.440 is the correct approach. It does not
00:22:25.440 treat the agent like a trusted employee.
00:22:28.000 That is the right mental model for where
00:22:29.679 we're at at this point in 2026. And it's
00:22:32.080 one that most of the Tik Tok buzz
00:22:34.159 tutorial crowd has not internalized.
00:22:37.200 Look, agents have existed for a while
00:22:39.200 now. APIs have existed for decades. The
00:22:42.000 concept of software transacting with
00:22:43.840 software predates the web itself. What's
00:22:46.480 new is all of these factors converging
00:22:49.440 to make the agentic web. In the span of
00:22:51.840 just a few months, every layer of the
00:22:53.919 stack went from concept to production to
00:22:56.320 infrastructure. Money, content, search,
00:22:59.360 execution, identity is all in production
00:23:03.360 now simultaneously. The web is starting
00:23:05.919 to fork. There's the human web, the one
00:23:08.240 you're reading right now or listening to
00:23:09.919 a video on right now with fonts and
00:23:12.400 layouts and images and scroll
00:23:14.000 animations. And at the same time, in
00:23:16.480 parallel, on another fork, there's the
00:23:18.640 agent web, a parallel layer of APIs,
00:23:21.600 structured data, markdown content,
00:23:23.679 payment protocols, and execution
00:23:25.360 environments designed for software that
00:23:27.200 will never open a browser. These two
00:23:29.280 webs run on the same physical
00:23:31.039 infrastructure, the same servers, the
00:23:33.120 same CDNs, the same payment rails, but
00:23:35.200 they serve fundamentally different
00:23:37.280 clients with different needs. A human,
00:23:39.440 we want a beautiful product page. An
00:23:41.520 agent, they want a JSON payload with the
00:23:43.679 price, the availability, and the payment
00:23:45.520 endpoint. A human might want search
00:23:47.360 results they can browse. An agent just
00:23:49.600 wants structured data to act on. You get
00:23:51.760 the idea. A human wants a checkout flow
00:23:53.679 with trust signals. the agent just wants
00:23:55.600 tokenized payment primitives and will be
00:23:57.360 getting on with its day. The analogy
00:23:59.360 that keeps coming to mind for me as I
00:24:01.120 look at this is the early mobile web. In
00:24:04.000 2007 when the iPhone launched, the web
00:24:06.960 already existed. It worked on phones
00:24:09.440 technically, but it was designed for
00:24:11.679 desktops and the experience I can
00:24:13.679 testify was terrible. What followed was
00:24:16.480 a decade long rebuild for the mobile
00:24:18.559 web. responsive design, mobile first
00:24:21.279 frameworks, app stores, push
00:24:23.279 notifications, GPSware services, tap to
00:24:26.240 pay. The underlying infrastructure was
00:24:28.320 the same, but the interface layer forked
00:24:31.360 completely. The companies that
00:24:33.200 recognized the fork early, that built
00:24:35.600 for the new client instead of trying to
00:24:37.440 make the old interface work on the new
00:24:39.440 device, those were the ones that built
00:24:41.360 the dominant platforms of the next era.
00:24:43.679 We are at the same inflection point
00:24:45.679 today except the new client isn't a
00:24:48.320 smaller screen. It's not a screen at
00:24:50.400 all. It's software that reads, decides,
00:24:53.440 pays, and acts. The interface it needs
00:24:56.559 isn't visual. It's structured. It's
00:24:58.640 programmable. It's transactional. And
00:25:00.799 the companies building that interface
00:25:02.640 right now, they're not the startups that
00:25:04.720 are hoping to get lucky. They're the big
00:25:06.400 boys. They're Coinbase, Stripe,
00:25:08.000 Cloudflare, Google, OpenAI, Visa,
00:25:10.240 PayPal. companies with the
00:25:11.919 infrastructure, scale, and distribution
00:25:14.320 to make their design decisions into de
00:25:17.120 facto web standards. The mobile fork
00:25:19.600 created trillion-dollar companies,
00:25:21.039 right? It created Uber, Instagram,
00:25:22.799 WhatsApp, Snap. They would not have
00:25:24.880 existed on the desktop web. Not because
00:25:26.960 the desktop web lacked capabilities, but
00:25:29.520 because it lacked the interface
00:25:31.120 primitives that mobile clients really
00:25:32.960 needed. It lacked real-time location,
00:25:35.120 always on connectivity, camera first
00:25:37.520 interaction, push notifications, tap to
00:25:40.080 pay at physical registers. The agent
00:25:42.320 fork is going to do the same thing again
00:25:46.000 in the 2020s. The businesses that emerge
00:25:48.559 from it will be the ones that could not
00:25:50.159 have existed on the human web, not
00:25:52.080 because the human web lacks information,
00:25:54.720 but because it lacks the interface
00:25:56.720 primitives that agent clients really
00:25:59.120 need. structured data, tokenized
00:26:01.279 payments, machine readable content,
00:26:03.200 programmatic search, execution
00:26:04.880 environments. In my last video on Open
00:26:07.120 Claw, I talked about the 7030 rule. The
00:26:10.000 idea that people consistently want to
00:26:12.159 maintain maybe roughly 70% human control
00:26:15.520 of agent delegated tasks. That's the
00:26:17.919 demand side. That's the human side of
00:26:19.440 the story, right? This video has really
00:26:21.919 been about the supply side of the story,
00:26:24.480 the agent side of the story. And that
00:26:26.880 side doesn't care about our 7030 split
00:26:30.000 or what kind of control we want to
00:26:31.600 maintain. The infrastructure that is
00:26:33.919 being built right now that I have spent
00:26:35.919 this video talking about assumes a 0
00:26:39.200 world. Fully autonomous agents with
00:26:41.760 their own wallets, their own search
00:26:43.679 capabilities, their own execution
00:26:45.600 environments, and their own economic
00:26:47.600 relationships with the services they
00:26:49.520 use. The gap between the infrastructure
00:26:52.080 being built and the trust people are
00:26:54.000 willing to extend to agents is the
00:26:57.279 central tension of the next few years in
00:26:59.679 AI. Every company in the agent stack is
00:27:02.400 betting that trust will catch up to the
00:27:05.360 capabilities that are being built today.
00:27:07.200 And every security incident that we see,
00:27:10.080 especially with the open claw story,
00:27:12.000 things like claw havoc, like the 500
00:27:14.960 message iMessage disaster, reduction
00:27:17.600 databases being wiped by unsupervised
00:27:19.840 agents, those kinds of stories push the
00:27:22.880 timeline of trust back even though they
00:27:25.600 don't stop people trying agents. For
00:27:27.360 now, the agent web is really small.
00:27:29.200 Developers running OpenClaw on Mac minis
00:27:31.360 and VPS instances, AI shopping
00:27:33.679 assistants placing orders through
00:27:35.120 Stripes ACPs. But I want to call out
00:27:37.679 that small now does not mean small
00:27:40.240 later. Because of how quickly Open Claw
00:27:43.039 is growing because of how much venture
00:27:45.520 funding is going into agents in 2026, we
00:27:48.480 are likely to see explosive growth in
00:27:51.840 this new branch of the web in 2026. I
00:27:55.440 don't know if a fully realized agentic
00:27:58.320 web arrives in 3 months, 3 weeks, or 2
00:28:01.840 years. That's an open question. that
00:28:04.080 it's being built is not a question and I
00:28:07.120 increasingly have no doubt we are headed
00:28:09.520 toward a world where agents are as
00:28:11.760 ubiquitous on the web as people. It is
00:28:14.159 up to us to shape those web standards so
00:28:17.200 they work well for both agents and
00:28:19.440 people. And it's up to us to make sure
00:28:21.440 the primitives that we build like
00:28:23.440 payments, like security, are robust
00:28:25.360 enough that we actually can trust agent
00:28:28.159 operations and agent economics, the way
00:28:30.240 we've learned to trust other humans for
00:28:32.880 commerce over the web. Without that base
00:28:35.440 layer of trust, the future of the
00:28:37.360 agentic web may be still born. And that
00:28:40.080 is the thing I want to leave you with.
00:28:41.840 What is going to build trust in the
00:28:45.200 agentic web? And as much as these
00:28:47.360 companies are investing in primitives,
00:28:49.440 the primitive of trust is something that
00:28:52.240 we are going to have to see realized
00:28:54.159 over time by good faith actors who are
00:28:58.320 building for a future where both humans
00:29:00.880 and agents work on the web together. If
00:29:03.760 you know of someone building in that
00:29:05.440 space, pop them in the comments. I'd
00:29:07.520 love to see them. Best of luck out there
00:29:09.600 and uh enjoy the wild agentic web. It's
00:29:11.919 going to be a crazy decade. Cheers.
